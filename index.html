            <p class="place__paragraph">Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city located on the shores of the
              Dnipro river. Of course, no one in their right mind would swim in the river, unless they grew up here, in
              which case they've probably tried it at some point. Summers are hot here, and the winters are drafty, but
              the fall and the spring are are absolutely amazing.</p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and soviet architecture,
              all of it sprinkled with modified balconies. If you're on the right bank of the Dnipro, the landscape is
              difficult to traverse for people on bikes and those wearing heels. The left bank is considered far less
              interesting and prestigious though, even by people who live on the far outskirts of the right one.</p>

            <p class="place__paragraph">The medieval ruin of Cricieth Castle overlooks the town below from a rock that
              juts out into the sea. It is thought to have been built by Llewelyn the Great in the 13th century. Some
              900 years later, the self-styled Pearl of Wales on the Shores of Snowdonia has become a popular tourist
              destination during the summer months.</p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">A short walk down the road from the castle, you can enjoy the world's best ice
              cream at Cadwalader's, whose secret ingredient is rumored to be locally sourced seaweed. Another claim to
              fame is the fact that Cricieth won the Wales in Bloom award for five years in a row for its spectacular
              floral displays around town. It was also home to David Lloyd George, the only Welshman ever to hold the
              office of Prime Minister of the UK.</p>

          <div class="place__main-text">
            <p class="place__paragraph">Berea is a small town located in the central part of Kentucky. The town is
              surrounded by beautiful forests and countryside. It's known as the arts and crafts capital of the state,
              and visitors will find plenty of shopping opportunities: shops with handmade jewelry, candles, wood items,
              galleries, glass studios, and more. The town holds a yearly festival celebrating "spoonbread", a local
              dish made with cornbread and served with a wooden spoon.</p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">However, it's probably known best for the local college. Berea College was
              founded in 1855 and was the first college in the south to be racially integrated, as well as the first to
              be coeducational. Somewhat uniquely, it charges no tuition — every student receives a full-tuition
              scholarship.</p>

          <div class="place__main-text">
            <p class="place__paragraph">Muramvya is one of the 18 provinces of Burundi. In the kingdom era, Muramvya was
              the royal capital and in 2007, because of its cultural and natural landscape, it was added to the UNESCO
              World Heritage Tentative List. It is located in the center of Burundi, between the country's political and
              economic capitals</p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">The weather is rather chilly at night, but during the day, you would think
              you're in heaven. At 2,665 meters (8,743 ft) above sea level, Mount Teza is one of the coldest places in
              the province. But that cool breeze allows for one of the largest plantations of tea and coffee in the
              country, which make up the bulk of Burundi's exports.</p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">The Kibira National Park, one of the largest wildlife reserves for apes,
              overlaps four provinces,
              including Muramvya. This National Park lies at the apex of the beautiful mountains of the Congo-Nile
              Divide, ranging between 1550 and 2660 meters of altitude. It is filled with beautiful vegetation, and a
              source for the various rivers and streams which provide water around the country.</p>

            <p class="place__paragraph">Bergamo holds the roots of its history inside its name, along with the charm of
              its ancient origins: a mountain (Berg) with a house on top (heim). Located right before the pre-Alps, the
              city on the hill used to be a Celtic settlement before the coming of the Romans in the year 49 b. C, when
              it became a Municipality. Over the centuries, this strategic natural stronghold overlooking the flatland
              experienced the dominations of Lombards and Frankish populations, up to the age of the communes, when
              Bergamo began to turn into the medieval gem we can admire today.</p>

            <p class="place__paragraph">Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city located on the shores of the
              Dnipro river. Of course, no one in their right mind would swim in the river, unless they grew up here, in
              which case they've probably tried it at some point. Summers are hot here, and the winters are drafty, but
              the fall and the spring are are absolutely amazing.</p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and soviet architecture,
              all of it sprinkled with modified balconies. If you're on the right bank of the Dnipro, the landscape is
              difficult to traverse for people on bikes and those wearing heels. The left bank is considered far less
              interesting and prestigious though, even by people who live on the far outskirts of the right one.</p>

            <p class="place__paragraph">The medieval ruin of Cricieth Castle overlooks the town below from a rock that
              juts out into the sea. It is thought to have been built by Llewelyn the Great in the 13th century. Some
              900 years later, the self-styled Pearl of Wales on the Shores of Snowdonia has become a popular tourist
              destination during the summer months.</p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">A short walk down the road from the castle, you can enjoy the world's best ice
              cream at Cadwalader's, whose secret ingredient is rumored to be locally sourced seaweed. Another claim to
              fame is the fact that Cricieth won the Wales in Bloom award for five years in a row for its spectacular
              floral displays around town. It was also home to David Lloyd George, the only Welshman ever to hold the
              office of Prime Minister of the UK.</p>

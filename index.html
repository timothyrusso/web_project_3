          world. Today, Practicum Art Gallery is proud to present stories and pictures from some of the people who
          dedicate their time and effort to making the future tech professionals of this town feel at home. Each of us
          has a unique story about the place we come from. Feel free to add your own story and a piece of visual art
          dedicated to your hometown to our collection. No matter where you're from, we're glad that you're our
